      Initialize Purse for Each Team:

      When a user registers for an auction event, they are assigned an initial purse amount (e.g., ₹10,000,000) in the User or Team table.
      This purse amount represents the budget they can spend on bidding.
      Track Bids in Real-Time:

      As each player comes up in the auction, teams can place bids within the Bid table.
      Each bid is recorded with:
      team_id: the team placing the bid,
      player_id: the player being bid on,
      bid_amount: the bid amount,
      is_highest_bid: a boolean to indicate the current highest bid for that player.
      The backend checks each bid to determine if it's the highest; if so, it sets is_highest_bid to true for the highest bid and deducts the bid amount from the team's purse.
      Validate Bids Against Available Purse:

      Before a team’s bid is accepted, the backend validates that the bid amount does not exceed the remaining purse.
      If the team’s remaining purse is insufficient for a bid, the system rejects the bid and informs the team.
      Update Purse on Winning Bid:

      When the 30-second timer for bidding ends:
      The Bid table is queried for the highest bid (is_highest_bid = true) for that player.
      The winning bid amount is deducted from the team's purse in the Team table.
      The winning player is assigned to the team, creating an entry in the TeamPlayer table.
      For teams that did not win the player, no purse deduction occurs.
      Frontend Purse Display:

      In the auction room UI, each team’s remaining purse is displayed and updated in real-time as bids are placed.
      If a team submits a bid, the system temporarily deducts the amount from the purse until the timer ends.
      Once a winner is confirmed, the purse of the winning team is permanently deducted.
      Error Handling and Feedback:

      If a bid exceeds the team’s remaining purse, the system immediately rejects the bid and prompts the user to place a bid within their budget.
      For smooth user experience, this validation can be done on both frontend (client-side check) and backend (server-side check).
